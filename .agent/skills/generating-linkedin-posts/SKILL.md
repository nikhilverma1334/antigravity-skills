# Arctic LinkedIn Post Generator

## When to use this skill
- When you need to draft professional updates for LinkedIn.
- When you want to transform technical topics or recent news into engaging social content.
- When the user requests multiple variations of a post to test different angles.

## Workflow
1. [ ] **Identify Topic**: Confirm the core subject matter from the user.
2. [ ] **Deep Research**: Use `search_web` to find latest trends, statistics, or unique insights on the topic.
3. [ ] **Select 4 Personas/Angles**:
    - **Strategy/Thought Leadership**: High-level vision.
    - **Instructional/How-To**: Value-driven actionable steps.
    - **Contrarian/Analytical**: Challenging common wisdom or data breakdown.
    - **Storytelling/Empathetic**: Personal or professional journey.
4. [ ] **Draft Options**: Generate 4 distinct posts including hooks, body, and CTA.
5. [ ] **User Selection**: Present options and ask the user which one they prefer for final polish.

## Instructions

### 1. Research Protocol
- Find at least 2 relevant statistics or recent quotes to ground the content.
- Identify common "pain points" associated with the topic to make the hooks more effective.

### 2. Post Structure Requirements
Every post must include:
- **The Hook**: A compelling first line (< 80 chars).
- **The Body**: Structured with clear spacing; no "walls of text".
- **The Call to Action (CTA)**: A question or prompt to drive comments.
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 relevant, high-traffic tags.

### 3. Option Archetypes
- **Option 1 (The Educator)**: Focused on "3 things I learned" or "How to solve X".
- **Option 2 (The Visionary)**: Focused on "The future of X" or "Why Y is changing".
- **Option 3 (The Analyst)**: Focused on a specific data point or a complex problem simplified.
- **Option 4 (The Growth Story)**: Focused on a failure, a lesson, or a professional milestone.

### 4. Style Standards
- Use professional yet conversational tone.
- Avoid "corporate buzzword" overload.
- Keep posts between 150-300 words.
